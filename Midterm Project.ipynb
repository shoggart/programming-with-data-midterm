    "Introduction:\n",
    "The objective of this independent research project is to analyze rates of COVID in Washington state by number of deaths, hospitalizations and positive tests over the course of a year spanning from March 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021 using Python in a Jupyter notebook and while utilizing various packages from the course such as Pandas, NumPy, etc... Various metrics will be used to analyze these data including cumulative cases as well as rates per day. The dataset I will be mainly working with comes from The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic Magazine. "

    "Relevancy:\n",
    "As mentioned above, the origin of our data for this research project comes from the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic. The data source is a CSV file containing numerous metrics pertaining to COVID statistics in Washington state. It covers everything from the obvious statistics such as total deaths and hospitalizations to more meticulous data such as ventilator statistics and positive antibody or positive antigen tests. This is a highly appropriate data source for our research project for various reasons; the main one being it contained an extensive number of metrics from which to analyze. This should be evident from the sizable number of columns and rows deleted from the dataset below using Pandas. "

    "Background: \n",
    "This field of inquiry is definitely of high value. COVID-19 essentially dictated the world for almost all of 2020. People have been very antsy to get back to some semblance of normalcy for quite some time now. There are few things I can think of that should be prioritized higher than when the world can safely start to reopen and people can resume there lives. The one thing about this topic that is perhaps one of its downfalls is that it has been very highly researched over the last year and a half. Literally, the entire world has been looking at these statistics and trying to draw conclusions from them since the beginning of 2020. That being said, "

    "Dataset Exploration:\n",
    "Illegal values such as NaN have been removed from the original dataset. Also, extensive time has been spent condensing the data set down to a 1 year time frame extending from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021. And that doesn't even mention the number of columns of data that needed to be removed to be left with a reasonable dataset. For the purpose of this project, I've decided to analyze this data set in the form of a Pandas data frame. The dataset has been modified where appropriate for whichever form of analysis is applicable. For example, in the beginning many columns and rows have been deleted for the sake of data manipulation. And at other times row indices have been reinitialized for the purpose of clarity of information. I've implemented a scatterplot to see how deaths per day measure up to the average over the course of a year during peak intervals of COVID-19 rates. "

    "Ethics:\n",
    "As stated earlier, the data came from the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic. This was an open source dataset that was free to download. The analysis of this data doesn't run the risk of creating new forms of intellectual property, by definition. Intellectual property is an invention of some sort that one has the rights to but there's no software or anything tangible to be gained from this analysis. However, there is a risk of discrimination in this analysis. COVID appears to have disproportionately affected poor people and different races which this analysis is not taking into consideration. The data only reports information about the entire state of Washington which could potentially underrepresent some demographics. I think this could create harmful assumptions if different communities are being affected disproportionately. For example, if the general trend of COVID cases in Washington state is going down people may feel more entitled to be more lax about social distancing and mask wearing. For instance, if the total number of cases is going down but cases are increasing in certain communities or demographics this could have dangerous repercussions for those communities. On a more positive note, this data is fully anonymous. It is purely statistical in nature and the manipulations on the data can be clearly identified. As far as biases are concerned, there is the possibility of bias that was mentioned earlier. For example, according to the Washington state Office of Finanicial Management, 78.7% of the total population of Washington is white. While 4.2% of the population is black and 9.2% of the population is Asian. The conclusion of this information is there exists the possibility for disparity in any statistical analysis of such a heavily dominated demographic. "

      "The first confirmed case relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States was announced by the state of Washington on January 21, 2020. Washington made the first announcement of a death from the disease in the U.S. on February 29 and later announced that two deaths there on February 26 were also due to COVID-19. Until mid-March, Washington had the highest absolute number of confirmed cases and the highest number per capita of any state in the country,[1] until it was surpassed by New York state on April 10, 2020. Many of the deceased were residents of a nursing home in Kirkland, an Eastside suburb of Seattle in King County.\n",
      "Governor Jay Inslee issued a statewide stay-at-home order on March 23, 2020 to last at least two weeks.[2][3]\n",
      "Washington had 417,687 confirmed cases and a total of 5,997 confirmed deaths as of July 9, 2021. Public health experts agree that the true number of cases in the state is much greater than the number that have been confirmed by laboratory tests. It is very difficult to know the true number since most people experience only mild illness and testing is not widely available.[4]\n",
      "As of May 28, 2021[update], Washington has administered 7,452,579 COVID-19 vaccine doses, and has fully vaccinated 3,143,910 people, equivalent to 42.46 percent of the population.[5] On June 30, 2021, the state plans to re-open fully, allowing all business to operate at full capacity. Full reopening may occur sooner if 70% of the state's population get their first dose of the covid-19 vaccination.[6]\n",

He had returned from Wuhan, China after visiting his family there, to the U.S., landing at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport on January 15, without any symptoms. He reported to an urgent care clinic with symptoms of pneumonia on January 19 and was transported to Everett's Providence Regional Medical Center the following day.[43][44][45] He was released from the hospital on February 3 after two weeks of treatment, including the use of the anti-viral drug remdesivir,[46][47] and went into isolation at home.[47][48] Some earlier cases, not confirmed by PCR, have also been reported as far back as December 2019.[49]\n",

Also on the 26th, a woman in her 80s from the center died at her family home.

      "The two largest state universities, University of Washington (UW) and Washington State University (WSU) curtailed on-campus classes during the pandemic. UW announced its closure on March 6; and on March 11, WSU announced the closure would begin after its spring break, on March 23.[235]\n",
      "On March 11, school districts in the Greater Seattle area, including Seattle Public Schools, Lake Washington School District, and Bellevue School District, announced their closures shortly after Governor Jay Inslee's social distancing proclamation in the morning.[236][237][238] Many school districts in Snohomish County also announced closures that would start in the next few days, including Snohomish School District, Monroe School District, Marysville School District, Everett School District and Edmonds School District.[239]\n",
      "On March 12, the governor invoked his emergency power and mandated the closure of all private and public schools in King, Pierce and Snohomish Counties, from March 16 through April 24 or later; the next day, he expanded the closure to all K-12 schools statewide.[240]\n",
      "All Thurston County schools, and Shelton School District (the largest district in Mason County) announced their closures beginning March 16, through at least April 24.[241][242]\n",
      "On April 6, it was announced that all Washington State K-12 schools would be closed through the end of the school year.[243] In July, Washington State University announced that the fall 2020 semester would offer full remote classes.[244]\n",

      "Sports[edit]\n",
      "Many scheduled public events went on as planned, including a Major League Soccer fixture between the Seattle Sounders FC and Columbus Crew SC at CenturyLink Field on March 7. It was played in front of a crowd of 33,080, making it the smallest crowd to ever attend a regular season MLS match in Sounders history.[245] Pundits attributed the lower attendance to the coronavirus as immunocompromised fans and others who did not want to attend the match due to the outbreak were offered full refunds.[246][247] ESPN noted the effect the governor's ban on gatherings in Puget Sound area would have on sports, especially if it should be expanded to Eastern Washington; the first round of the 2020 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament was scheduled to be held in Spokane in March.[174] NCAA basketball was subsequently cancelled altogether. On March 12, Major League Baseball cancelled the remainder of spring training, and on March 16, they announced that the season will be postponed indefinitely, after the recommendations from the CDC to restrict events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks, affecting the Seattle Mariners.[248]\n",

      "Arts and media[edit]\n",
      "Seattle Artists Relief Fund was established to help artists, especially in the performing arts, cope with the loss of patrons due to the pandemic-related shutdowns.[249] Included in the closures were the Pacific Northwest Ballet and the Seattle Symphony.[250]\n",
      "Most of the state's newspapers removed paywalls for COVID-19 information, including The Seattle Times, the Tacoma News Tribune, Bellingham Herald, Peninsula Daily News, The Olympian, Tri City Herald, Wenatchee World, The Columbian, The Spokesman-Review, and the Yakima Herald-Republic.[251][252][253] The Seattle Times was praised for its early coverage of the outbreak, including public service announcements and question-and-answer sessions with readers.[254] The Stranger, an alt-weekly newspaper in Seattle, announced a temporary layoff of 18 employees to offset ad revenue losses due to the closure of restaurants and entertainment venues.[255]\n",
      "On March 24, a public radio station in the state, KUOW-FM, announced it would no longer broadcast the White House press briefings on the coronavirus \"due to a pattern of false or misleading information provided that cannot be fact checked in real time.\" Nevertheless, KUOW stated that it will continue to provide relevant information and news regarding the pandemic from the press briefings.[256]\n",

      " Interior of Vancouver, Washington restaurant open for takeout only on March 16\n",
      "The economic loss to the region due to canceled cruise ship visitors to Seattle was unknown as of mid March, with the Port of Seattle \"exploring options.\" The industry brings in nearly one billion dollars annually to the Puget Sound area, with the Alaska cruise season considered to start April 1.[257][258] On March 11, 2020, the Port of Seattle announced the cancellations of April 1 and 5 planned cruise ship sailings.[259] On March 13, 2020, the Government of Canada deferred the start of their cruise ship season to July 1, 2020.[260] As noted by the Port of Seattle, \"United States maritime laws require foreign flagged vessels, which include many cruise ships, to stop at a foreign port on a U.S. port to U.S. port itinerary. This is why most Seattle to Alaska cruise itineraries visit Victoria, and changes in Canada can impact Seattle-based cruises.\"[261] On March 14, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a 30-day no sail order impacting all cruise ships subject to U.S. jurisdiction.[262][263]\n",
      "The landmark Space Needle closed on March 13 through March 31.[264] Many of the vendors at Pike Place Market—those who sell nonessential items—closed on March 23 following the statewide stay-at-home order, but some food vendors remained open as of March 31.[265] Several major conventions, including the Emerald City Comic Con at the Washington State Convention Center in Seattle, were cancelled or postponed in response to the coronavirus crisis.[266][267] Many Western Washington tribal casinos announced their closures on March 16, although not subject to the state government proclamations. Closures were at the Muckleshoot, Puyallup, Snoqualmie, Suquamish and Tulalip casinos in King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties.[268][269]\n",

      "Travel and transportation[edit]\n",
      " Most of the passenger cabin of MV Spokane was closed off to encourage passengers to stay in their cars.\n",
      "Several public transit agencies in Western Washington announced cuts to service and free fares to avoid contact between passengers and drivers. King County Metro, the largest operator serving Seattle, will reduce service and suspend the South Lake Union Streetcar.[270] Large agencies in the Puget Sound region are also anticipating a decline in revenue from sales taxes, which would cause delays or changes to major projects.[271] Sound Transit announced in early April that it would suspend construction on most of its light rail expansion projects due to high absenteeism among workers and difficulty meeting social distancing guidelines at worksites.[272]\n",
      "On March 24, 2020, the Port of Seattle stated that a Transportation Security Administration security officer working at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport had tested positive for COVID-19. The officer had last worked on March 21 at Checkpoint 5 which would be closed for cleaning.[273]\n",
      "Nearly all Washington State Ferries routes had significant service reductions due to lack of ridership, and those taking a car on the ferry were encouraged to stay in their vehicle.[274] Service to Southern British Columbia was canceled.[275][276]\n",
      "The closure of the Canadian border isolated Point Roberts, an pene-exclave of Washington connected by land to British Columbia. A temporary ferry service was established in August 2020 to link Point Roberts to Bellingham.[277]\n",

      "Restarting the economy[edit]\n",
      "The cities of Bellevue, Kirkland, Issaquah, Redmond, and Renton launched (re)STARTUP425 as an initiative to restart the Eastside economy after the COVID-19 shutdown.[278] Models of infectious disease from Institute for Disease Modeling, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, and others guided Washington State government decision-making concerning how and when to lift emergency restrictions.[279]\n",
      "\n",
      "Reactions to November 15 restrictions issued by Governor Jay Inslee[edit]\n",
      "Hospitality industry leaders have voiced their concerns over the new restrictions. Prior to the restrictions being enacted the Washington State Hospitality Association estimated that hospitality sales was down 45%. Reacting to the new restriction, WSHA President Anthony Anton stated \"This is devastating news, this leads to 100,000 workers out of work right before the holidays. This will lead to more permanent closures and end more dreams. What makes it frustrating is we believe we could have worked together to make good decisions.\"[280]\n",
      "Restaurant owners have been pushing back on the claims made by Jay Inslee that data supports the decision to close indoor dining. The CEO of Fire and Vine Hospitality, which owns a group of restaurants in the Seattle area, Chad Mackay, says the data doesn't support such strict measures on restaurants, and that the government has not been consistent in the use and application of that data. He stated on a local talk radio station, \"...The contact tracing that was done showed that less than half a percent of infections were contact traced back to restaurants. And that’s what we’ve been arguing, saying why are we not looking at that data. And now they say that data is wrong. I think the great line was ‘an absence of evidence doesn’t mean an evidence of absence,’ which means we don't know.\" He claims that the Governor is citing a study done by Stanford about the spread of COVID-19 in restaurants and notes that the study does not argue for shutdowns, but rather capacity restrictions.[281]\n",
